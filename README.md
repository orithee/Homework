# Mentor-Student Project

This project is a homework assignment I received.
In short, the task was to build a website that allows the mentor to log in, choose an exercise and send the student a link to join a separate page where they can work on the exercise live.

The complete instructions are attached in one of the pictures below.

Link to the website:

## At the main entrance only the mentor can enter:

User : Tom |

## In the unique link of the selected student, these are the details:

User : Josh |
Password : 119836532
